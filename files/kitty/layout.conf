#: The window padding (in pts) (blank area between the text and the
#: window border). A single value sets all four sides. Two values set
#: the vertical and horizontal sides. Three values set top, horizontal
#: and bottom. Four values set top, right, bottom and left.
# window_padding_width 0

#: The window margin (in pts) (blank area outside the border). A
#: single value sets all four sides. Two values set the vertical and
#: horizontal sides. Three values set top, horizontal and bottom. Four
#: values set top, right, bottom and left.
# window_margin_width 0

#: If enabled, the window size will be remembered so that new
#: instances of kitty will have the same size as the previous
#: instance. If disabled, the window will initially have size
#: configured by initial_window_width/height, in pixels. You can use a
#: suffix of "c" on the width/height values to have them interpreted
#: as number of cells instead of pixels.
# remember_window_size  yes
# initial_window_width  640
# initial_window_height 400

#: The width of window borders. Can be either in pixels (px) or pts
#: (pt). Values in pts will be rounded to the nearest number of pixels
#: based on screen resolution. If not specified the unit is assumed to
#: be pts. Note that borders are displayed only when more than one
#: window is visible. They are meant to separate multiple windows.
# window_border_width 0.5pt

#: Draw only the minimum borders needed. This means that only the
#: minimum needed borders for inactive windows are drawn. That is only
#: the borders that separate the inactive window from a neighbor. Note
#: that setting a non-zero window margin overrides this and causes all
#: borders to be drawn.
# draw_minimal_borders yes

#: The window margin (in pts) to use when only a single window is
#: visible. Negative values will cause the value of
#: window_margin_width to be used instead. A single value sets all
#: four sides. Two values set the vertical and horizontal sides. Three
#: values set top, horizontal and bottom. Four values set top, right,
#: bottom and left.
# single_window_margin_width -1

#: When the window size is not an exact multiple of the cell size, the
#: cell area of the terminal window will have some extra padding on
#: the sides. You can control how that padding is distributed with
#: this option. Using a value of center means the cell area will be
#: placed centrally. A value of top-left means the padding will be on
#: only the bottom and right edges.
# placement_strategy center

#: The color for the border of the active window. Set this to none to
#: not draw borders around the active window.
active_border_color #fabd2f

#: The color for the border of inactive windows
inactive_border_color #504945

#: The color for the border of inactive windows in which a bell has
#: occurred
# bell_border_color #ff5a00

#: Fade the text in inactive windows by the specified amount (a number
#: between zero and one, with zero being fully faded).
# inactive_text_alpha 1.0

#: Hide the window decorations (title-bar and window borders) with
#: yes. On macOS, titlebar-only can be used to only hide the titlebar.
#: Whether this works and exactly what effect it has depends on the
#: window manager/operating system. Note that the effects of changing
#: this setting when reloading config are undefined.
# hide_window_decorations no

#: Path to a logo image. Must be in PNG format. Relative paths are
#: interpreted relative to the kitty config directory.  The logo is
#: displayed in a corner of every kitty window. The position is
#: controlled by window_logo_position. Individual windows can be
#: configured to have different logos either using the launch function
#: or the remote-control facility.
# window_logo_path $HOME/.local/kitty.app/share/icons/hicolor/256x256/apps/kitty.png

#: Where to position the window logo in the window. The value can be
#: one of: top-left, top, top-right, left, center, right, bottom-left,
#: bottom, bottom-right.
# window_logo_position bottom-right

#: The amount the logo should be faded into the background. With zero
#: being fully faded and one being fully opaque.
# window_logo_alpha 0.5

#: The time (in seconds) to wait before redrawing the screen when a
#: resize event is received. On platforms such as macOS, where the
#: operating system sends events corresponding to the start and end of
#: a resize, this number is ignored.
# resize_debounce_time 0.1

#: The list of characters to use for visual window selection (for
#: example for selecting a window to focus with focus_visible_window).
#: The value should be a series of unique numbers or alphabets, case
#: insensitive, from the set [0-9A-Z]. Specify your preference as a
#: string of characters.
# visual_window_select_characters 1234567890ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

#: The enabled window layouts. A comma separated list of layout names.
#: The special value all means all layouts. The first listed layout
#: will be used as the startup layout. Default configuration is all
#: layouts in alphabetical order. For a list of available layouts, see
#: the https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/overview/#layouts.
# enabled_layouts *

#: The step size (in units of cell width/cell height) to use when
#: resizing kitty windows in a layout with the keyboard
#: (start_resizing_window). The cells value is used for horizontal
#: resizing and the lines value for vertical resizing.
# window_resize_step_cells 2
# window_resize_step_lines 2

#: Ask for confirmation when closing an OS window or a Tab with at
#: least this number of kitty windows in it by window manager (e.g.
#: clicking the window close button or pressing the Operating system
#: shortcut to close windows) or by the close_tab action. A value of
#: zero disables confirmation. This confirmation also applies to
#: requests to quit the entire application (all OS windows, via the
#: quit action). Negative values are converted to positive ones,
#: however, with https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/shell-integration/
#: enabled, using negative values means windows sitting at a shell
#: prompt are not counted, only windows where some command is
#: currently running. Note that if you want confirmation when closing
#: individual windows, you can map the
#: https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/actions/#close-window-with-
#: confirmation action.
# confirm_os_window_close 0
