#: will be rendered with a "reverse video" effect. It's color will be
#: the color of the text in the cell it is over and the text will be
#: rendered with the background color of the cell.  Note that if the
#: program running in the terminal sets a cursor color, this takes
#: precedence. Also, the cursor colors are modified if the cell
#: background and foreground colors have very low contrast.
# cursor #cccccc

#: Choose the color of text under the cursor. If you want it rendered
#: with the background color of the cell underneath instead, use the

#: The cursor shape can be one of (block, beam, underline). Note that
#: when reloading the config this will be changed only if the cursor
#: shape has not been set by the program running in the terminal. This
#: sets the default cursor shape. Applications running in the terminal
#: can override it. In particular,
#: https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/shell-integration/ in kitty sets
#: the cursor shape to beam at shell prompts. You can avoid this by
#: setting shell_integration to no-cursor.
